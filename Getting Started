The graphical interface is implemented in qt-designer(PyQT5).
Installation
The GPL version of PyQt5 can be installed from PyPI:
Windows:
pip install PyQt5

The wheels include a copy of the required parts of the LGPL version of Qt.
pip will also build and install the bindings from the sdist package but Qtâ€™s qmake tool must be on PATH.
The sip-install tool will also install the bindings from the sdist package but will allow you to configure many aspects of the installation.

Mac OS:
You can use brew to install pyqt (in the terminal):
brew install pyqt

On Ubuntu Linux / Debian Linux you can use the command:
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5

If you are new to Python PyQt, then I highly recommend official documentation (https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/)
